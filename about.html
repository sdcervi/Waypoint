	<h1>About Waypoint</h1>
	
	<p>Waypoint is designed to help you track progress toward goals for virtual or real-world distance challenges. Don&rsquo;t waste time fiddling with spreadsheets or doing math by hand in a notebook; Waypoint does it all for you.</p>
	<p>While popular distance challenge hosts such as <a href="https://www.theconqueror.events/">The Conqueror Challenge</a> or <a href="https://adventure.mypacer.com/">Pacer</a> have their own apps that synchronize with fitness tracking systems (Apple, Garmin, Fitbit, etc), not all of them do. Some challenge hosts ask you to submit proof of your distance and time for each challenge via their website, which can be cumbersome and tedious. Some simply ship your medals after registration, and use the honor system. Waypoint uses the honor system too, but in a way that puts ownership back in your hands.</p>
	<p>Waypoint is intended to simplify this process by giving you a clean, intuitive, simple interface with which to track all of your active challenges. It doesn&rsquo;t require personal data such as a screenshot or GPS coordinates, but most challenge hosts should accept a screenshot of Waypoint as proof a challenge is complete, if needed.</p>

	<h2 class="mt-5">Contribute to future development of Waypoint</h2>
	
	<p>Waypoint is free to use, and always will be. We don&rsquo;t believe in the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; business model, where you get a limited feature set for free and the actually useful feature set is locked behind a subscription. We&rsquo;ll also never run ads; you hate &rsquo;em, we hate &rsquo;em.</p>
	
	<p>That being said, there are costs to developing and making web apps available, including domain name, hosting, and service fees for the database provider. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to the future development and maintenance of Waypoint, please consider <a href="https://ko-fi.com/sdcervi" target="_blank">sending a few dollars our way on Ko-Fi</a>, or <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1178395889/sport-medal-honeycomb-display-plaque" target="_blank">buying display plaques for your shiny new medals</a>. Donations are by no means required, but every one is appreciated. Thank you for your support!</p>

				<h3>Stephanie Cervi</h3>
				<p>Stephanie is a graphic and web designer in California. She originally started developing Waypoint for herself as an alternative to poorly designed tracker apps and for challenges that lack tracking entirely.</p>
				<p>Her main motivations for completing distance challenges are to improve her health and manage her chronic illness&rsquo;s symptoms better, and because the finisher medals look cool on her wall. Whatever works, right?</p>
