### Summary
Distance Goals is designed to help you track progress toward goals for virtual or real-world distance challenges. Some challenge hosts have no way to sync with fitness tracking apps, or their own usable tracking system.

Donâ€™t waste time fiddling with spreadsheets or doing math by hand in a notebook; Distance Goals does it all for you.

#### Development
Distance Goals was initially developed as a practice project to improve my JavaScript skills, learn `localStorage` data interaction, and mostly just to see if I could build a single-page application without having to take any formal classes.

### Technologies
Distance Goals was built using the Bootstrap 5.1 framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  There's a little bit of jQuery but most of it is vanilla ES6 JavaScript.

I designed it to be used primarily on mobile devices, for a 375px-wide viewport and larger.  Everything was then scaled up and rearranged for larger screens as needed.

### Features
- Add new challenges
- Edit existing challenge details
- Add progress to a challenge incrementally
- Delete existing challenges
- Export all user data
- Import user data from exported file

### Use cases
While popular distance challenge hosts such as The Conqueror Challenge or Pacer have their own apps that synchronize with fitness tracking systems (Apple, Garmin, Fitbit, etc), not all of them do.  Some challenge hosts ask you to submit proof of your distance and time for each challenge via their website, which can be cumbersome and tedious.  Some simply ship your medals after registration, and use the honor system.  Distance Goals uses the honor system too, but in a way that puts ownership back in the user's hands.

Distance Goals is intended to simplify this process by giving users a clean, intuitive, simple interface with which to track all of their active challenges.  It doesn't require any personal data such as a screenshot or GPS coordinates, but most challenge hosts should accept a screenshot of Distance Goals as proof a challenge is complete, if needed.

### Project status
Distance Goals is being actively maintained.  Bugs are logged and fixed as discovered.
